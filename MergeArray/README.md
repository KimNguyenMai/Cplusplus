Suppose A, B, C are arrays of integers of size M, N, and M + N respectively. 
Each array will get populated by random generator ranging from 0 to 1000. 
The numbers in array A appear in ascending order (if not in order, use a built-in qsort)
while the numbers in array B appear in descending order. 
Write a user defined function in C++ to produce third array C by merging arrays A and B in ascending order. 
Use A, B and C as arguments in the function.
